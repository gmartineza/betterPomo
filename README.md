# How do I use it?

## Better Pomo

Once you start the program, it relies on you to stop the "working period" when you are feeling tired. Automagically, the Python code will calculate the amount of rest that corresponds how much time you have been working, and it will notify you when said time is up. Rinse and repeat.

## Minimum Pomo

Input the minimum amount of time you want to be working and a timer will be started. 2 minutes is recommended. Upon completion you are encouraged to keep going, so a stopwatch will automatically start counting the focused "overtime".
